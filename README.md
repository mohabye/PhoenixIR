LinuxIR.py - Unified Linux Incident Response and Threat Hunting Tool
A powerful, Python-based tool designed for incident response and threat hunting on Linux systems. LinuxIR.py streamlines forensic artifact collection and threat analysis, providing cybersecurity professionals and system administrators with a comprehensive, unified workflow.
üöÄ Features
Module 1: Artifact Collection

System Logs: Collects syslog, auth, kernel, and boot logs
Authentication Artifacts: Gathers wtmp, btmp, utmp, passwd, and shadow files
Bash History: Extracts command history for all users
System Information: Captures running processes, network connections, and installed packages
Cron Jobs: Collects scheduled tasks and cron configurations
Network Artifacts: Gathers network configurations and routing tables
Web Server Logs: Collects Apache, Nginx, and other web server logs
Persistence Mechanisms: Identifies startup scripts and systemd services
File Timeline: Creates a timeline of recently modified files
SSH Artifacts: Collects SSH configurations and keys
Temporary Files: Analyzes contents of /tmp, /var/tmp, and /dev/shm

Module 2: Threat Hunting and Analysis

Log Analysis: Automated parsing of system and authentication logs
Command History Analysis: Identifies suspicious commands and patterns
Process Analysis: Detects unusual or malicious processes
Network Analysis: Examines network connections and routing anomalies
Package Analysis: Identifies potentially malicious installed software
Timeline Analysis: Correlates file modification times with suspicious activities
Risk Assessment: Provides a comprehensive security risk evaluation

üéØ Use Cases

Incident Response: Rapidly collect and analyze forensic artifacts
Threat Hunting: Proactively search for indicators of compromise
Security Auditing: Perform regular security assessments
Compliance: Gather evidence for regulatory requirements
Forensic Analysis: Conduct in-depth digital forensics investigations

üîç Analysis Categories
The tool evaluates artifacts across multiple severity levels:
High Severity Indicators

Failed authentication attempts (>10)
Suspicious command execution (e.g., netcat, base64 decoding)
Processes running from temporary directories
History clearing commands
Unauthorized privilege escalation

Medium Severity Indicators

Moderate failed login attempts (1-10)
Sudo usage to root
Suspicious installed packages
Large bash history files
Recent file modifications in sensitive locations

Low Severity Indicators

Unusual network routes
Analysis errors or missing artifacts
General system anomalies

Informational Findings

SSH connection logs
Cron job executions
System statistics and counts

üé® Output Features

Color-Coded Output: Easily identify findings with color-coded terminal output
Severity-Based Classification: Categorizes findings as HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, or INFO
Detailed Reports: Generates CSV and JSON reports for further analysis
Compressed Archives: Includes MD5 checksums for integrity verification
Comprehensive Logging: Tracks all collection activities

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
Permissions

Root access is required for complete artifact collection
The tool will warn if not run with sufficient privileges
Some artifacts may be inaccessible without proper permissions
